# Responsive Group Page

This project is a demonstration of a responsive group page designed for both mobile and desktop platforms. The primary goal of this task is to evaluate UI implementation skills from scratch. The webpage has been developed to ensure complete responsiveness.

- **Responsive Design:** The group page is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

- **Banner:** A visually appealing banner is included on the home page to enhance the overall user experience.

- **All Posts Section:** The home page features an "All Posts" section to showcase various posts or content related to the group.

- **Login & Signup Modals:** The login and signup modals are implemented to appear on click, similar to other modal functionalities. No actual authentication or page switch functionality is included as this task focuses solely on the UI.
